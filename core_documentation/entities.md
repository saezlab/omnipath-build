# Entities and relations

Every resource version publishes the same normalized Parquet tables. The schemas
are defined once in [`omnipath_core/schema.py`](../packages/core/omnipath_core/schema.py)
and [`molecular_forms.py`](../packages/core/omnipath_core/molecular_forms.py).
The current contract is `serving_schema_version = 5`; build manifests stay at
`schema_version = 1`.

| Table | One row is | Refers to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `entity` | one [entity](glossary.md#entity): identity, label, type, taxon, references | |
| `entity_identifier` | one identifier of an entity | `entity_id` |
| `entity_annotation` | one entity-level attribute | `entity_id` |
| `entity_evidence` | one standalone source occurrence of an entity | `entity_id` |
| `relation` | one [statement](glossary.md#statement): subject, predicate, object, sign, qualifiers | |
| `relation_annotation` | one statement-level attribute | `relation_id` |
| `relation_evidence` | one source occurrence of a statement, with its molecular forms | `relation_id` |
| `evidence_payloads` | one source row: the original payload as JSON | `relation_key` / `entity_key`, `row_id` |

`entity_id` and `relation_id` number the rows of `entity.parquet` and
`relation.parquet`, which are sorted by their keys; child tables refer to their
parent by that id and keep the parent's order in `ordinal`. The 64-character
`entity_key` and `relation_key` identify the same entity or statement across
resources. Each table is sorted by its lookup column in 8,192-row groups, so a
lookup reads only the row groups it needs.

The API also reads three **serving tables** per resource version. They are derived
lookup indexes, listed in the build manifest but not part of the downloads:

| Table | One row per | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relation_endpoint` | endpoint key (entity or reference key) of a relation | a key's relations |
| `entity_group` | group of an entity: reference key, gene of a product, chemical connectivity | groups, gene and chemical pages |
| `entity_term` | lowercase label or identifier of an entity | search |

> **Decision: normalized tables with integer row ids.** Identifiers, annotations
> and evidence are child tables instead of nested lists, and refer to their entity
> or relation by its row number. *Why:* lookups by key read a few row groups
> instead of whole nested rows, and integer references halved the release size
> (7.7 instead of 14.6 GB). The logical tables are the ones a PostgreSQL load
> uses. Compression stays at zstd's default level, with small row groups.

> lists and groups are derived from the published tables and are only needed to
> serve the explorer quickly. (7 October 2026)

## Three questions, three fields

An entity row answers three different questions. Keeping them apart is the
central design choice of the schema.

| Field | Question | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_entity_key` | Which gene (or chemical) is this about? | `entrez:7157` |
| `entity_type` | What did the source describe? | `protein` |
| `molecular_form` (on evidence) | Which product, isoform, modifications or variants did this occurrence report? | `uniprot:P04637`, isoform `P04637-2` |

A record can say *gene reference `entrez:7157`* and *type `protein`* at the same
time. These are compatible statements: the namespace of the reference does not
determine the molecular type the source reported.

```yaml
# Source reports a specific isoform of p53.
entity_type: protein
reference_entity_key: entrez:7157
evidence[0].molecular_form:
  protein_entity_key: <key of the uniprot:P04637 protein row>
  isoform_identifier: {ns: uniprot, id: P04637-2}

# Source reports the TP53 gene itself: a separate, gene-typed row.
entity_type: gene
reference_entity_key: entrez:7157
evidence[0].molecular_form: null

# Source reports a protein but only gives a GeneID: still protein-typed.
entity_type: protein
reference_entity_key: entrez:7157
evidence[0].molecular_form: null
```

> **Decision: keep the source's entity type.** `entity_type` stays what the
> source reported. Resolving a protein to a gene reference does not change its
> type to `gene`. We rejected moving the source type into a separate
> `participant_type` field. *Why:* protein-level and gene-level knowledge are
> different claims, and users need to see the difference. As a result, a
> protein row and a gene row of the same gene are separate entities with the
> same `reference_entity_key`. (5 October 2026)

> **Decision: missing means unspecified.** An absent molecular form, isoform,
> modification or variant means the source did not say. It never means
> gene-level evidence, the canonical isoform, an unmodified protein or the wild
> type. Older evidence without molecular context stays unknown. *Why:* treating
> silence as a claim would create false results in form queries.

## Keys

Keys are deterministic SHA-256 hashes ([`keys.py`](../packages/core/omnipath_core/keys.py)).

- **`entity_key`** = hash(`entity_type`, `namespace`, `identifier`). A protein
  resolved to gene 7157 and a gene resolved to gene 7157 therefore have
  *different* entity keys and share one `reference_entity_key`.
  Unresolved names and synonyms are additionally scoped by source and taxon, and
  unresolved gene symbols by taxon, so equal strings from different contexts are
  not merged.
- **`relation_key`** = hash(subject key, predicate, object key, Biolink
  qualifiers). Symmetric predicates without qualifiers sort their endpoints
  first. Ontology statements are hashed separately (`statement_kind = ontology`).

## `entity`

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `entity_id` | Row number in this resource version's `entity.parquet` |
| `entity_key` | Row identity (see above) |
| `entity_type` | Biolink type reported by the source, e.g. `protein`, `gene`, `small_molecule` |
| `namespace`, `identifier` | The canonical identifier of this row, e.g. `uniprot` / `P04637` or `inchikey` / … |
| `taxon` | NCBI Taxonomy ID; empty when sources disagree |
| `label` | Display name, chosen by the resolver |
| `reference_entity_key` | Shared grouping reference, normally an NCBI Gene CURIE |
| `gene_reference_keys[]` | Catalogue gene links of a product row (a protein can link to several genes) |
| `group_connectivity` | First InChIKey block of an `inchikey:` reference: the chemical structure group |
| `has_hierarchy`, `parent_count`, `child_count` | Ontology position, from distinct ontology edges |
| `identifier_count`, `annotation_count`, `evidence_count`, `relation_count` | Number of the entity's child rows and relations |

Child tables, each with `entity_id` and `ordinal`:

- `entity_identifier`: all admitted identifiers `{ns, id, is_canonical, source}`.
- `entity_annotation`: entity-level attributes `{term, value, quantity_*, source, dataset}`;
  a measurement's fields are the `quantity_*` columns.
- `entity_evidence`: standalone source occurrences of this entity, each with its own
  `molecular_form`.

> **Decision: the resolver's label is the display name.** Entity resolution picks
> one label per entity; the build and the API do not re-rank names afterwards.
> A chemical structure group shows the preferred one of its members' labels.
> (7 October 2026)

Product rows (primary UniProt proteins and specifically reported transcripts)
are ordinary typed entity rows. Observations point to them through
`molecular_form.protein_entity_key` or `transcript_entity_key`. We do **not**
create an entity for each combination of isoform, modification and variant.

> **Decision: no entity per molecular state.** Reusable protein and transcript
> entities exist, but isoform/modification/variant combinations stay on the
> occurrence. Modifications and variants are stored individually so they can be
> queried. *Why:* the number of combinations is unbounded, and combining evidence
> for X+Y with X+Z must not invent an X+Y+Z form. A state model can be
> reconsidered if pathway state transitions need it. (4 October 2026)

## `relation`

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `relation_id` | Row number in this resource version's `relation.parquet` |
| `relation_key`, `statement_kind` | Identity; `relation` or `ontology` |
| `subject_entity_key`, `predicate`, `object_entity_key` | The statement; predicate is a Biolink predicate |
| `subject_type` / `object_type`, `*_label` | Endpoint type and label, copied for convenience |
| `subject_reference_entity_key`, `object_reference_entity_key` | Endpoint gene references, used for grouping |
| `taxon`, `is_directed`, `sign` | Scalar summary; `sign` is `1`, `-1` or `0` |
| `category`, `interaction_class` | Presentation categories, e.g. `interaction` / `directed_inhibitory` |
| `sources[]`, `evidence_count`, `annotation_count` | Contributing resources, number of occurrences and of annotations |
| `object_aspect_qualifier[]`, `object_direction_qualifier[]`, `causal_mechanism_qualifier[]` | The statement's Biolink qualifiers, for filtering |

`relation_annotation` holds the statement-level attributes, with a `scope` of
relation, subject or object; `relation_evidence` holds every occurrence (below).

### Evidence

Each `relation_evidence` row is one source occurrence:
`{source, dataset, row_id, upstream_id, annotations[], subject_molecular_form, object_molecular_form}`.

- Evidence is a **[multiset](glossary.md#evidence)**: identical occurrences stay separate.
- The two molecular forms stay **paired** on their occurrence. If a symmetric
  relation flips its endpoints, the forms and annotation scopes flip with it.
- Gene-level evidence is never copied onto proteins of that gene.
- `row_id` links to `evidence_payloads.parquet` for the raw source record.

> **Decision: evidence is a multiset with paired forms.** Every source
> occurrence stays a separate evidence item, even when identical, and its
> subject and object forms stay together. *Why:* counts and filters need the
> real occurrences, and a union of forms across a relation would lose which
> participants were observed together.

> **Decision: conflicting taxa project to empty.** The scalar `taxon` is filled
> only when the assertions agree; otherwise it is empty and each occurrence keeps
> its own. *Why:* picking one species would hide a real conflict.

## Molecular form

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `protein_entity_key` / `transcript_entity_key` | Points to the reusable product row, set by resolution only |
| `isoform_identifier` | `{ns, id}` that specifically identifies the reported isoform |
| `sequence_identifiers[]` | Other identifiers that pin the exact sequence |
| `modifications[]` | `{term, residue, position, end_position, coordinate_reference, description}` |
| `variants[]` | `{identifier, reference, alternate, position, end_position, coordinate_reference, description}` |

Positions keep the coordinate reference the source used (identifier and
version, coordinate system, position base). An unknown reference stays unknown;
it is not replaced with the selected primary protein.
