# PostgreSQL alignment with main

Keep the current resolved Parquet outputs and prototype resolution unchanged. Adapt their PostgreSQL projection so the database follows the current main branch's relational model, derivations, indexes and product contracts. Biolink terms and their associated qualifiers and quantities remain the vocabulary adaptation.

This plan began with a read-only comparison. The authorized implementation is now in progress; the bounded pilot is separate from the full release build. Parquet outputs, resource builders and serving deployments remain unchanged.

## Reference and scope

The baseline is GitHub main at `9f9bb709c764e2721a0bcd881cf7ef0eb22bed9a`, fetched on 1 October 2026. Its source and tests match the existing `legacy/postgres` copy exactly. Reuse that code when practical, rather than independently recreating its behavior.

An untracked snapshot is at [main-reference/9f9bb709c764](../main-reference/9f9bb709c764/). It contains 169 files: Python source, SQL, tests, pipeline documentation, build configuration and deployment files. [SNAPSHOT.json](../main-reference/9f9bb709c764/SNAPSHOT.json) records the commit, dependency gitlinks and file checksums; all 169 copied files were verified. Submodules were recorded, not copied or updated. [source-contract-inventory.json](../main-reference/9f9bb709c764/source-contract-inventory.json) indexes source DDL and literal index specifications. It includes conditional and scratch definitions, so it is not an executed database catalog.

The older running beauty production database is useful for consumer checks and storage comparison. It is not the complete current-main contract: for example, current main has the interaction projection and preset framework that the older production build does not fully contain.

The boundary is:

`Existing pinned Parquets → DuckDB relational projection → main-compatible PostgreSQL base → main derivations and indexes → main product tables and queries`

Entity resolution stays before Parquet publication. PostgreSQL consumes published identities; it does not rerun parsers, choose different canonical identities or call a resolver to repair them. Independent Parquet updates and the separate monthly PostgreSQL release schedule remain unchanged.

## What needs to change

| Area | Current migration gap | Required PostgreSQL work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical graph | `entities` and `relations` are resource records; `entity` and `relation` are aggregating views. | Restore main's physical canonical `entity` and `relation` tables and their evidence links. Keep resource versions in additive provenance metadata rather than repeating whole records. |
| Identity representation | Published SHA256 keys are repeated as long text foreign keys. | Use main-compatible compact UUID columns and a deterministic crosswalk back to the unchanged published keys. Audit identity, taxonomy and uniqueness conflicts before selecting the mapping; do not truncate hashes or silently merge distinct published entities. Matching old build UUID values is a separate issue from matching column types. |
| Dimensions and vocabulary | Source, dataset, namespace, type, predicate and scope strings recur in large tables. | Restore `data_source`, `dataset` and main's vocabulary tables with numeric foreign keys. Populate the relevant vocabulary names with Biolink values and explicit namespace mappings. |
| Partitioning | The large migration base tables are unpartitioned. | Restore main's source partitions, default partitions, parent constraints and partition indexes. Load resolved rows through DuckDB into these structures. |
| Identifier storage | Every resource entity has its own identifier occurrence rows. | Restore globally deduplicated `identifier_evidence`, with `entity_identifier` and `entity_evidence_identifier` links. Restore normalized search fields, uniqueness rules and the physical `entity_identifier_lookup` table. |
| Annotation storage | Each occurrence repeats terms, values, provenance and owner text; nested records repeat them again. | Restore the `annotation` value dictionary and `entity_evidence_annotation` / `relation_evidence_annotation` links. Preserve scope and published quantities without merging measurements that differ in unit, prefix or comparator. Keep main's public columns; any additional Biolink quantity representation should be narrow and keyed to the annotation. |
| Evidence ownership | Relation evidence is an ordinal child; there is no equivalent of main's original entity evidence layer. | Project published relation evidence into `relation_evidence` and `relation_evidence_relation`; provide entity evidence and its canonical links from information actually retained. Preserve published source, dataset, row and upstream identities through an explicit mapping. Original entity occurrence details need the feasibility audit below. |
| Annotation relationships | Main's `entity_annotation_relation` bridge is absent. | Restore it for entity-valued annotations that existing published identifiers and statements identify unambiguously. Do not invent a resolved annotation target. |
| Record JSON | Entities, relations and evidence retain complete nested JSON copies. | Replace the remaining view, query and loader readers with relational reads, then omit `record_json` from the aligned build. Raw source bodies remain outside PostgreSQL. Small product attributes and build metadata are still appropriate JSON uses. |
| Gene and state interfaces | `gene_output`, `gene_protein_representative`, `state`, `state_component` and `evidence_state` are absent. | Restore their schema and expose supported content from published identities, aliases and annotations. Do not recanonicalize proteins to genes or manufacture missing molecular state information. Exact semantic parity requires the feasibility audit. |
| Names and labels | Display values come from the published records and canonical view selection. | Restore main's `entity_name` projection, label columns, label rules and search support. Reuse main's display-selection rules where the published aliases support them; keep identity separate from display labels. |
| Classification | Main's chemical class, metabolic domain and predicate-to-interaction-class derivations are missing. | Reuse the classification rules and YAML configuration, adapting their vocabulary lookups to Biolink. Populate the same query-facing columns and vocabularies. |
| Ontology representation | The migration's `entity_ontology_relation` stores recognized hierarchy edges, and `ontology_terms` is a view. | Restore main's source-scoped ontology term and ontology relation tables, including non-hierarchy ontology statements. Restore the aggregated `entity_ontology_term` fields, aliases, synonyms and search indexes. Existing closure helpers may remain internal where needed, with the same hierarchy meaning. |
| Counts and source summaries | Counts describe direct incidence; source lists are text arrays. | Restore main's complete `entity_relation_counts`, including ontology annotation counts and `search_count`, plus numeric source lists in `entity_source_count`. |
| Bitmap search | No bitmap extension or bitmap tables are built. | Restore `entity_bitmap_id`, `relation_bitmap_id`, `annotation_term_entity_bitmap`, `annotation_term_direct_relation_bitmap`, `entity_relation_bitmap`, `facet_entity_bitmap` and `facet_relation_bitmap`. Reuse main's bitmap derivation and ontology expansion. |
| Resource overlap | The migration uses resource-record self-joins and text source pairs. | Restore main's numeric-source `resource_overlap_summary` and bitmap-intersection algorithm after the facets are built. |
| Chemical structure groups | Main's structure-level grouping and ambiguity tables are absent. | Restore `chemical_resolution_level`, `chemical_resolution_group`, `chemical_resolution_group_member`, `chemical_resolution_relation` and `chemical_ambiguous_name_candidate` from published structure identifiers. These summarize loaded identities; they must not resolve entities again. |
| Authority and coverage | Main's authority, role, conflict, coverage and lipid graph contracts are missing. | Restore supported `identifier_authority`, `identifier_role`, `chemical_resolution_coverage`, `resolution_conflict`, `lipid_name_node` and `lipid_name_edge` outputs. Distinguish available published facts from old resolver diagnostics or external lipid metadata that are unavailable. |
| Interaction projection | The migration does not build main's interaction layer. | Restore `interaction`, `interaction_party`, `interaction_fact_resource` and role vocabulary: participant grain, resource-specific assertions, three-valued sign/direction, measurements, references, curation and provenance. Feed it the resolved relational substrate with Biolink mappings. |
| Resources and licenses | Main's `resources` summary and `data_source_license` are absent. | Restore resource names, descriptions, counts, input provenance, license levels and known/unknown handling. Read metadata without running resource parsers; restrict summaries to the selected release. |
| Build manifest and capabilities | Migration release/checkpoint metadata replaces main's consumer-facing manifest. | Restore `build_manifest` and `build_capability`. Keep exact Parquet pins and existing checkpoint metadata alongside them. Report upstream resolution provenance honestly; do not imply PostgreSQL performed resolution or has diagnostics it lacks. |
| Keys, constraints and indexes | Most definitions differ from main, beyond vocabulary changes. | Reuse main's PKs, FKs, uniqueness rules, B-tree and GIN indexes, trigram and pattern operator classes, partial predicates, included columns and extended statistics. Compare definitions, not just index names or counts. Audit canonical uniqueness against the unchanged published identity model. |
| Network products | Recipes are partly retained, but queries fold statements within source pages and do not reproduce main's endpoint collapse and interaction classes. | Use main's fact-table contracts, resource-scoped selection and collapse, grain, composition, licensing and attribute behavior. Fold before pagination where the contract requires complete groups. Current main uses presets; do not recreate obsolete production materialized networks merely because they exist on beauty. |
| MetSigDB | Membership uses a different base schema, text IDs and reduced constraints; the eligibility policy also differs. | Restore main's membership columns, UUID references, checks, indexes, set semantics and provenance using the aligned substrate. Preserve the previously approved published-chemical eligibility policy unless explicitly changed; record it as an existing exception, not a Biolink change. |
| COSMOS | Source events remain separate instead of main's participant-multiset interaction grouping; IDs and some constraints differ. | Reuse main's interaction-based grouping, edge table, pseudo-node and connector conventions, directions, label status and indexes. Adapt catalyst/participant vocabulary reads to Biolink. Keep batching improvements where row results are unchanged. |
| Derivation orchestration | The migration has a separate, reduced sequence. | Restore main's dependency order: base keys/indexes; search and ontology summaries; chemical groupings; classifications; interaction projection; names/labels; authority; bitmaps; overlap; resources/manifest; selected products. Run each stage once. |
| Database runtime | The private migration uses PostgreSQL 16 without the search extensions; main ships PostgreSQL 18. | Reuse main's PostgreSQL image for later isolated parity builds, including roaringbitmap and pg_trgm support. RDKit is bundled for the separate metabo layer. Do not upgrade or replace a running database as part of this planning work. |
| Serving and cleanup | Current queries depend on resource-record views; reset/refresh logic follows the new model. | Make existing PostgreSQL consumers work against main's table/query contracts, and align reset/refresh dependencies and dictionary orphan handling. Keep temporary projection data internal and distinguish scratch tables from attached partitions. |

## Limits that must be checked first

Matching table names is not enough. Main expects some information that the serving Parquets do not explicitly retain.

1. **Resolver status and decisions.** A published canonical identifier or resolver-sourced alias does not recover the exact old matched, unresolved, ambiguous, reason or mechanism flags. Do not label every published entity as an old resolver match. The agreed MetSigDB policy already handles one consequence; other status-dependent consumers need an explicit compatibility treatment.
2. **Original entity occurrences.** Entity Parquets aggregate identifiers and annotations and lack the original entity row, parent occurrence and role fields. Relation evidence retains more source context. Existing payload pointer columns can provide some source-row provenance without decoding raw bodies, but they do not prove the original nested entity tree or identifier-to-occurrence associations.
3. **Identity and taxonomy.** The prototype and main do not necessarily use identical identity granularity. Source-scoped fallback names, gene anchoring and taxon handling can conflict with main's canonical uniqueness constraints. Preserve the published resolution and test those collisions; do not solve them by merging entities or resolving them again.
4. **Qualifier and measurement identity.** Main's graph relation key is an endpoint/predicate triple, while published statement keys can distinguish Biolink qualifiers. Preserve the distinct claims through evidence and the interaction layer or a narrow association before collapsing graph triples. Verify that deduplicating annotations retains quantity distinctions.
5. **External enrichment.** Some lipid metadata and identifier label translations in main depend on Utils or post-build services. Reuse published values where sufficient. Keep unsupported capabilities explicit rather than introducing a second downstream resolver.

For each limit, record whether it is directly representable, reproducible through a PostgreSQL/DuckDB projection, or unavailable from the existing artifacts. Exact parity of an unavailable diagnostic cannot be promised. The solution remains within the existing Parquet contract.

The `metabo_*` chemistry/structure tables seen in production belong to the separate omnipath-metabo post-build layer. This plan restores its required build substrate and capability reporting; it does not absorb that other service or reproduce its datasets inside omnipath-build.

## Implementation order

1. **Audit the compatibility boundary.** Create a column-by-column mapping for main's base and interaction inputs, with explicit treatment of the five limits above. Use tiny existing fixtures and bounded reads of published artifacts; no resource rebuilds.
2. **Align the base projection.** Reuse main's DDL in the active PostgreSQL package, add the compact crosswalk and release metadata, and project existing Parquets through DuckDB into dictionaries, canonical tables, evidence links and source partitions. Remove nested record JSON from this new layout once its readers use relational data.
3. **Restore the complete index contract.** Reuse all applicable main definitions and extensions, retaining deferred creation after COPY. Test actual constraints, operator classes, predicates and statistics definitions in a disposable database.
4. **Restore derivations.** Port main's search, ontology, chemical, classification, interaction, label, bitmap, overlap and manifest steps. Change vocabulary reads where necessary; preserve algorithms and result meaning. Keep existing checkpoints and tested equivalent performance improvements.
5. **Align products and consumers.** Restore main's MetSigDB, network and COSMOS contracts over the aligned substrate. Resolve documented limitations explicitly rather than changing a scientific policy silently.
6. **Exercise a bounded pilot.** Use representative protein, chemical, ontology and reaction fixtures, capped at 20 source records where records are built. Compare full result rows and relevant consumer queries, not only counts. Benchmark a small selection of indexed searches and product queries.
7. **Plan the full server load after the pilot.** Reuse the existing pinned release in a separate destination. Preserve production and the prior pilot schemas. The user subsequently authorized removal of the previous approximately 190 GiB full migration schema to make room. Report the pilot milestone before starting a full build.

The first implementation milestone is steps 1–3: a bounded load from the unchanged Parquets into main-compatible base tables, with the dictionaries, partitions and applicable main index/constraint definitions in place, plus a written list of any remaining information gaps.

## Code reuse and acceptance

Start from these main modules and their matching tests:

- `db/schema.py`, `db/indexes.py` and the relational COPY contracts in `duckdb_load.py`.
- `db/derived_tables.py`, `db/bitmaps.py`, `db/resources.py` and `db/licenses.py`.
- `classify/`, `labels/`, `chemical_resolution_level.py`, `shared_interaction_schema.py` and `relation_rules.py`.
- `network_views/`, `metsigdb/` and `cosmos/`, including their SQL and contract tests.
- `postgres/Dockerfile` and the derive orchestration in `cli.py`.

The active package structure stays. Move reusable code into the appropriate PostgreSQL/subsets package and adapt imports and the database driver as needed; avoid two maintained implementations of the same downstream algorithm. Do not invoke main's old load/resolver path against the Parquets.

Acceptance requires the main table, column, key, partition, index, statistics and query contracts, with an explicit list of Biolink adaptations and any genuinely unavailable inputs. Representative scientific projection results must retain source evidence, measurements, qualifiers and product grain. Upstream resolution differences must be separated from downstream regressions when comparing data.

Development parity tests do not reintroduce a mandatory exhaustive post-build verification, rebuild-and-rollback run or automatic safety gate. Keep the loader's artifact and loaded-data integrity checks, base checkpoint, complete-product commits and selected-product resume. The later server authorization permits removal only of the previous full migration schema and a new isolated main-compatible build. Both original pilot schemas, all Parquet artifacts, cache/reference and production/prototype services are protected.


## Implementation progress, 1 October 2026

The active PostgreSQL package now reuses main's DDL, numeric dictionaries, source partitions, exact constraints/index definitions and downstream implementations. DuckDB projects the unchanged published artifacts into compact canonical tables and evidence links. Narrow companion tables preserve original published identities and structured quantities; no nested record JSON or raw source bodies are loaded.

The base commits after COPY counts, keys, foreign keys and indexes succeed. Each complete product commits its tables, release identity and both publication metadata interfaces together. PostgreSQL-only finish retains the base and completed products. The subsets command dispatches to this main implementation for aligned schemas while retaining historical schema support.

The first synthetic Parquet pilot loaded all 20 base/provenance tables and restored deferred constraints. Bounded comparisons against frozen main have passed for actual schema definitions, signed/resource-owned interaction facts, merged reaction chemistry, measurements, labels and COSMOS rows. A fresh second pilot exposed extension placement in the first pilot schema; the isolated bitmap extension was relocated to public with its dependent objects preserved. This is being covered by a two-schema regression before the full load.

Real-artifact identity audit: 6,383,473 entity rows, 2,181 shared keys with one known taxon plus an empty unknown marker, 7 keys with multiple actual taxa, and 39 conflicting source-scoped name groups. Published keys are retained. Known taxonomy is selected only when unambiguous; original source-owned taxonomy and fallback identities remain available.

The new private PostgreSQL18 destination is separate at loopback5441. The previous full schema was removed under the user's explicit cleanup authorization, freeing192.47GiB; both prior pilot schemas, all artifacts and protected services were retained. The full46-resource aligned load has not started. The column map and independent parity checklist record limitations caused by facts absent from the unchanged Parquets.
