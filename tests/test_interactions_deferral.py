"""The catalogue round trip across a deferred load.

The projection loads ``interaction``, ``interaction_party`` and
``interaction_fact_resource`` with their foreign keys and secondary indexes
**dropped**, and puts them back before the step ends. A measurement priced it
at 709.7 s against 1,814.7 s over the four tables that existed then, with the
largest step falling from 674.0 s to 272.2 s — sixty per cent of that step was
constraint and index maintenance rather than the work of building a header.

**The saving is only a saving if the far side of the step is the near side.**
So this file asserts the round trip rather than the seconds: the same
constraints, the same indexes, every definition identical string for string,
and the same rows, class counts and sign-conflict summary as a load that
deferred nothing.

**A restored-but-``NOT VALID`` key is the failure this file exists to catch.**
Postgres will happily take a foreign key back as ``NOT VALID``: it looks like a
constraint in ``\\d``, it is enforced on every row written **after** it, and it
says nothing whatever about the fourteen million rows the load just wrote. That
is not the constraint the schema declares, and a deferral that returns one has
traded a guarantee for time. Every foreign key is therefore asserted
``convalidated`` by the catalogue, not by its presence.

The counts come from the schema rather than from the note that priced the
deferral. That measurement was taken on 2026-08-20 over **four** tables and
recorded 15 constraints and 20 indexes, 13 of them foreign keys and 18
secondary. Removing ``interaction_fact_combined`` — four foreign keys and nine
indexes — left the amended schema holding **11 constraints and 11 indexes**, of
which **9 foreign keys and 9 secondary indexes** are what the deferral drops
and restores. The two primary keys stay through the load, because the header
insert deduplicates with ``ON CONFLICT (interaction_id) DO NOTHING`` and needs
its unique index while the insert runs.

The fixture graph is a dozen relations, so nothing here measures anything. It
is the round trip that is being asserted, and the round trip is a property of
the mechanism rather than of the row count.
