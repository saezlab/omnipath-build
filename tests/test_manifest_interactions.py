"""The manifest records interaction derive cost and the preset inventory (T020a).

R24 leaves one interaction table, so the cost block names it alone (T020b):
``interaction_fact_resource``, the record. Every measured query scope still
reports what materialising it cost — the scopes this build declined to
materialise included (FR-050) — and ``interactions_deferral_cost`` reports what
the deferred load saved and what restoring the catalogue cost (T013k, R23).

Both are volatile — per-step seconds and row counts, and the registered preset
list — so they are written next to the identity hash, never inside it. These
tests assert the manifest carries them and that two builds over identical inputs
still agree on ``build_id`` when their timings differ (the cycle-007 lesson).

Run against a build database, e.g. on dev4::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://omnipath:omnipath@localhost:5404/omnipath \
        uv run --with pytest pytest tests/test_manifest_interactions.py -v

The manifests are written into a throwaway schema, so the build's own
``public.build_manifest`` row is never rewritten. Skipped without DATABASE_URL.
