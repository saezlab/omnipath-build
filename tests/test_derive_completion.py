"""Integration tests for Milestone A: derive completion + count/overlap tables.

Asserts the post-`derive` state of a built OmniPath database:
- the derive ran end-to-end (resources, facet bitmaps, and the ontology
  entity-relations tables populated),
- the new derived tables ``entity_source_count`` and ``resource_overlap_summary``
  exist, are populated, and answer their queries quickly,
- no *unattached* ``*_staging`` leftover tables remain (the orphan sweep ran;
  attached ``*_staging`` partitions are live data and are kept).

Run against a built instance, e.g. on beauty::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://omnipath:omnipath@localhost:5404/omnipath \
        uv run pytest tests/test_derive_completion.py -v

Skipped when DATABASE_URL is not set (no DB to test against).
