"""US7 / FR-027: a UniProt AC mapping to >1 gene is split per gene.

The rare identical-gene-copies case (one UniProt AC, several NCBI genes producing
identical protein) MUST be **split into one gene-anchored record per gene**, each
carrying the same form as state (molecular_type = protein, uniprot = the AC); the
protein-centric view re-collapses them. No anchor is chosen and nothing is dropped.

DELIVERED (T061). The split is realised **1:1**: a multi-gene UniProt mention is
*duplicated* per gene before resolution (``omnipath_build/multigene_split.py``),
each copy resolving to its own gene and carrying the same UniProt as a protein
``state``. So the signature of a performed split is **one UniProt AC appearing as
a protein state under >1 distinct gene entity** (not one evidence → many genes,
which the 1:1 model deliberately avoids). The explosion logic itself is unit-
tested deterministically in ``tests/test_multigene_split.py``; this test is the
integration check and **skips** when a capped build retains no multi-gene case.

Run against a built instance, e.g. on beauty::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://omnipath:omnipath@localhost:55432/omnipath \
        uv run pytest tests/test_uniprot_multi_gene.py -v

Skipped when DATABASE_URL is not set (no DB to test against).
