"""The interaction header id is content-addressed (008 T012/T012a, FR-002).

``interaction.interaction_id`` is a deterministic hash of the **sorted
participant multiset** and the interaction class, so it is endpoint-independent:
the same participants handed over in a different order name the same
interaction, and a rebuild over unchanged inputs mints no new headers. That is
what makes ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` a safe, additive rebuild and what lets a
caller ask for an interaction from either endpoint.

The identity is defined twice — as a DuckDB macro next to ``content_uuid``
(``duckdb_load.py``, the load side) and as a SQL expression in the derive step
(``db/derived_tables.py``, the Postgres side). Both must produce the same uuid
for the same content, so the cross-engine agreement is asserted here rather than
assumed.
