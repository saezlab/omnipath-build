"""Sign and direction, per resource and per scope.

**Amended 2026-08-20.** Sign and direction are asserted **per resource**, on
``interaction_fact_resource`` — the record. The collapse of that record over a
resource set is one scope's fold rather than the stored grain. So the file
holds three layers of assertion: what a single resource says on its own row,
what the all-resources collapse says, and what a collapse restricted to a
resource subset says. A resource that is silent leaves NULL on its own row and
never inherits what a neighbour on the same endpoint pair asserted. A scoped
collapse reports the kept resources' count, references and sign flags alone:
selecting a wider collapse's row and filtering it with ``sources &&
ARRAY[...]`` returns the right interaction carrying the wrong numbers, and the
scope tests here are built on a three-resource pair precisely so that
implementation fails them.

**Amended 2026-08-21.** The collapse is no longer a table and no longer a build
routine: ``interaction_fact_combined`` is dropped and
``collapse_interaction_scope`` is deleted, because the derive has no caller for
a fold and the query path has one, in the api-service. The collapse assertions
here read ``tests.fixtures.collapse`` instead — the fold written once on the
test side, as a view for the all-resources scope and as a statement for a
scoped one. Every assertion below is the one it was: they were about what a
collapse must report, never about where it was stored.

``is_directed``, ``is_stimulation`` and ``is_inhibition`` are **three-valued**.
NULL means *no contributing resource asserts the attribute*, which is a
different statement from an asserted ``false`` — 97.4 per cent of the graph's
edges carry no sign at all, so a design that defaulted them to ``false`` would
mislabel 13.9 million edges as "known not stimulatory". Where resources
disagree, **both** sign flags are true: the disagreement is represented, never
resolved by a silent winner. And ``sources``/``references`` list **every**
contributor, including the ones asserting neither sign nor direction, so
``sign_source_count <= cardinality(sources)`` is a real inequality.

The second half covers the sign-conflict summary the derive step measures on
every build — signed rows, both-flags-true rows and their percentage, and the
single-resource versus cross-resource split — is produced and reaches the build
manifest **without** entering the ``build_id`` hash, because it is a
measurement of the build, not part of its identity.
