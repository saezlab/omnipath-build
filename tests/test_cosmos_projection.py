"""A reaction becomes substrate and product edges around a per-reaction node.

The causal-reasoning prior knowledge network is a **binary** graph: every edge
is one metabolite and one gene, and the reaction itself survives only as the
node the two sides meet at. Projecting the build's N-ary reaction headers into
it is therefore a rewrite, not a flattening, and this file asserts the four
things the rewrite has to get right.

* **The enzyme node is per reaction.** The same protein catalysing five
  reactions is five nodes, ``Gene1__P00533`` through ``Gene5__P00533``, because
  a reasoning method treats each of them as an independently switchable step.
  The index is a modelling artifact, which is why it lives in its own table and
  never in ``entity``, and it has to be **stable across rebuilds** — a label
  that moved between runs would make every downstream comparison meaningless.
* **Only the two sides of the arrow project.** A substrate reaches the enzyme
  node and the enzyme node reaches a product. Nothing joins a substrate to a
  product, nothing joins the enzyme to itself, and a party row holding a role
  that names no side of the arrow — a cofactor, a regulator — is left alone
  and counted, because a genome-scale model has no such role and reading one as
  a substrate would state something the resource did not.
* **A reaction nobody names an enzyme for keeps its edges.** It is the majority
  shape in a metabolic model. The reaction stands in for the unknown catalyst,
  the row says so in ``orphan``, and no reaction is dropped for want of a
  catalyst.
* **The labels reach the namespaces the network reads, or say that they did
  not.** COSMOS is written against UniProt on the gene side and ChEBI on the
  metabolite side, and the build hands the projection whatever identifier its
  resources agreed on. A metabolite typed ChEBI gains the prefix the build
  does not store and the network does; a catalyst a mapping answers for
  becomes an accession; a catalyst nothing answers for keeps its own
  identifier, and both endpoints of every edge record the namespace their
  label actually carries, so a fallen-back node cannot be mistaken for a
  translated one. A run with no mapping database at all falls every label
  back and still emits the whole network.
* **A reversible reaction runs both ways, and only a reversible one does.** The
  resource states the direction on the reaction event, under two spellings per
  value. A reversible conversion gains the mirrored pair — every product into
  the enzyme, every reactant out of it — on a ``_rev`` copy of the gene node
  alone, never of the metabolite. A one-way conversion gains nothing. A
  conversion nobody published a direction for gains nothing either, and says
  so with a null rather than by looking one-way, because a source that is
  silent and a source that says left to right are different claims.

    reason to fail a projection over content the build already wrote, so both
