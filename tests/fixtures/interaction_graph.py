"""A small hand-built canonical graph for the interaction-projection tests.

The interaction derive step projects ``relation`` and its
``relation_evidence`` provenance into ``interaction``, ``interaction_party`` and
``interaction_fact_resource``. Asserting its semantics against the full build
would make the assertions depend on whatever the resources happen to say this
week, so the projection tests build this fixture instead: a dozen relations in
a throwaway schema, each one carrying exactly the situation a requirement talks
about.

What the graph is built to exercise:

* ``ligand_receptor`` from **participant-role** evidence (tier 1),
* ``allosteric`` and ``orthosteric`` from **interaction-level** annotation
  (tier 2), ``signaling``/``transport`` from the **predicate** (tier 3) and
  ``other`` as the fallback,
* a pair whose resources **disagree** on sign (both flags true, cross-resource),
* a pair where **one** resource asserts both signs (single-resource conflict),
* a contributor asserting **neither** sign nor direction, so
  ``sign_source_count <= cardinality(sources)`` is a real inequality,
* a pair with **no sign at all**, so the sign columns stay NULL, and
* an **opposite-direction pair**, which must stay two rows.

Beside the ordered endpoint pairs the graph carries three **stars**, the shape a
metabolic resource publishes a reaction in: a parent entity and one
``has_participant`` relation per member, with the member's role, stoichiometry
and compartment riding on the relation evidence at **object** scope, and the
catalyst arriving as a sibling ``controls`` edge that points *at* the parent.

* two reaction parents with the **same** member multiset, reported by two
  different resources, so the hyperedge projection is asserted to merge them
  into one header rather than to mint one per resource,
* a transport parent whose members carry a membrane side rather than a
  subcellular location, and
* a **pathway** parent, which uses the same ``has_participant`` verb and must
  **not** become a hyperedge — the reaction projection keys on the parent's
  entity type, not on the predicate, and a pathway with two hundred members
  would otherwise mint a two-hundred-way interaction, and
* a reaction parent whose **whole** participant set is the two entities an
  ordinary pair already joins, which is the one shape where the two readings
  hash to the same header id.

Three further reaction stars are there for the **binary metabolic projection**,
which reads a reaction party row by party row and turns it into substrate and
product edges around a per-reaction enzyme node:

* an ordinary catalysed conversion, two substrates and one product, one of the
  substrates stated **without** a compartment,
* a conversion **no resource names an enzyme for**, which has to keep its edges
  rather than be dropped for want of a catalyst, and
* a conversion carrying a **cofactor** and a **regulator** beside its
  substrates, neither of which stands on a side of the arrow.

Five more carry a **direction**, which a resource states on the reaction event
as an entity annotation rather than on any one membership: two reversible
conversions, two one-way ones and a reversible one nobody names an enzyme for.
Each direction appears under both of the spellings the build holds, so a
projection that folded only one of them is caught rather than assumed correct.
Three of the reactions above carry **no** direction at all, which is what a
resource publishing only the chemistry looks like.

Two more stars hold the same metabolite on **both** sides of the arrow, which
is the shape a binary transport is read out of. One carries it across a
membrane — a reactant in the cytosol and a product outside — and the other
consumes and regenerates it in one compartment. Both statements ride on one
membership, because ``relation`` is unique on its endpoint triple and the role
lives on the evidence row rather than on the relation, so the two are told
apart by the evidence they sit on. What separates them is the compartment and
nothing else, so a projection reading the roles alone publishes a transporter
for the reaction that transports nothing.

Beside those single-situation rows the graph carries a **coverage pair per
interaction class**: one ordered endpoint pair for every class the graph can
evidence, each reported by two resources that both publish a reference. Those
are what let the dedup and provenance rule be asserted class by class instead
of on ``signaling`` alone, and they are the reason a class reached only by a
verb no rule maps cannot pass unnoticed. One endpoint pair carries **two**
classes at once, which turns the class into a claim about rows rather than
about a column.

Every id is fixed, so a test can name the row it means.
