"""The collapse of the interaction record, for the tests that assert its shape.

Data model §3b, as amended by research R24: the collapse of
``interaction_fact_resource`` for a resource scope is what a **query** produces
at request time, and it is not a table. The build stops when the record lands,
so ``interaction_fact_combined`` — the all-resources scope materialised — is
gone, and with it ``collapse_interaction_scope``, the build routine that filled
it (T013e).

The assertions that table carried are not gone. FR-044a's three-valued flags,
FR-044c's provenance over every contributor, FR-044d's ordered key and R18's
class precedence are all statements about **the collapse**, and they hold or
fail whether the collapse is stored or computed. So this module is the oracle
those tests read: the fold, written once, in SQL, on the test side.

**It is a test fixture and not a second implementation.** The production fold
has exactly one caller — the api-service, under T020i — which is the whole of
what R24 bought by removing the materialisation. What lives here is the
specification of that fold in executable form: the same aggregate on the same
column, so an engine that folds differently fails a test in the repository that
owns the record rather than agreeing with itself in the repository that owns
the query.

The scope is the resource set, exactly as it was on the removed routine.
``None`` means every resource — the all-resources scope, which is the shape the
removed table held — and an **empty** sequence is an empty scope, which
collapses to no rows. That is a different answer from "no restriction", and the
difference is the point of stating the scope at all.
