"""Schema-existence and population tests for the interaction model (008).

Constitution III: every new table this cycle adds is asserted to exist and to
carry rows after a build. Five tables make up the model — the header
``interaction`` (data model §1), the participant ``interaction_party`` (§2),
the participant-role vocabulary ``vocab_relation_role`` (§7), the interaction
record ``interaction_fact_resource`` (§3a) and the resource license terms
``data_source_license`` (§8a).

**Amended 2026-08-20.** ``interaction_fact_combined`` was
the projection; it became one scope's materialisation of a record kept per
contributing resource.

**Amended 2026-08-21.** That materialisation is removed. The
derive writes **three tables and folds nothing** — the header, the participant
and the record — and §3b is the shape a query produces at request time, not a
table. The tests follow: the projection is asserted to write exactly those
three, no ``interaction_fact_combined`` may survive a build in any non-system
schema, ``ensure_schema`` is asserted to drop one a pre-change database still
carries, and the anchoring rule of §3b — the detail tables anchor on the
record through the denormalised triple — is asserted against the Postgres
catalogue. The collapse-equivalence assertions this file used to carry moved
to the api-service, which is where the fold now lives.

The schema half runs against a throwaway scratch schema, so it needs no data.
The population half reads the built schema and needs a build — a capped
``MAX_RECORDS`` build is enough, because the assertion is that the derive step
produced rows at all, not how many.

    Data model §3 as amended: there is **one stored fact table**, and no
    scope is precomputed — not even the all-resources scope, which is the one
    the removed ``interaction_fact_combined`` held. The two halves belong in
    one test because either alone is satisfiable by the wrong build: three
    populated tables say nothing about a fourth still being written, and an
    absent fourth table is what a derive that produced nothing at all also
    looks like.

    The absence is asserted across **every** non-system schema rather than only
    the built one. A build writes into the schema it is pointed at, and a copy
    left in a second schema is exactly the stale 4.68 GiB the removal is for.
