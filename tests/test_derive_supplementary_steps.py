"""A supplementary step that fails cannot leave the build looking successful.

MetSigDB and the network views are caught on purpose: a published dataset over
the core content must not abort the build that produced the content it reads.
The gap was that nobody could tell it had happened. The error went to the
package logger, `make` exports `config/pkg_infra_quiet.yaml`, and a derive that
published nothing printed its usual summary and exited 0. A real build did
exactly that on 2026-09-02: the substrate was never written and the only trace
was `metsigdb_membership.last_vacuum` still reading a week old.

Two things close it. The failure prints on the channel the steps' own progress
already uses, which no logging config suppresses. And the derive exits 1, so a
caller that reads exit 0 as "the database is ready" is not misled.

No database is touched.
