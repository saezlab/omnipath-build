"""MetSigDB is a step of the build, not something a person remembers to run.

Cycle 010 shipped the substrate as a Python entry point with no caller, so a
fresh build produced a database with no ``metsigdb_membership`` at all and the
API answered 503. This covers the wiring that fixed it, in the shape cycle 008
established for the network views:

- the ``derive`` runs it by default, and ``--no-metsigdb`` opts out;
- it runs **after** the build manifest, whose stamp every published row carries;
- a failure is loud but does not abort the build, exactly like the network
  views and unlike the interaction projection;
- ``metsigdb`` is also a subcommand of its own, for a rebuild without a derive;
- ``reset-content`` truncates the substrate, so a reload cannot leave rows
  keyed on entity ids that no longer exist.

No database is touched: the build step is stubbed.
