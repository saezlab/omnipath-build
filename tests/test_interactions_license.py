"""License filtering over the interaction record (008 T013h, FR-049, SC-022, R20).

A license is not a name. `pypath/internals/license.py` models it as three
**ordinal** levels — ``purpose``, ``sharing``, ``attrib`` — and defines
``enables(other)`` as ``self >= other``, so "usable commercially" is a
comparison over three smallints and never a match on ``license_name``. Two
resources under different names can permit the same use, and one name under two
versions can not. `data_source_license` (data model §8a) stores the levels, and
a license question resolves to a **set of resources** before anything touches
the interaction tables.

Two properties this file exists to pin:

**Unknown terms are exclusions, never defaults.** A resource with ``is_known =
false`` MUST NOT appear in a license-filtered result. This is the one failure
mode of the table that cannot be detected downstream — an admitted unknown
looks exactly like an admitted known — so it gets its own test, and the fixture
is adversarial: the unknown resource is stored with the *most permissive levels
the vocabulary has*. If the resolution consults the levels rather than
``is_known``, it admits it, and the test says so.

**A license filter restricts the resource set, so the scope rule applies**
(R19, FR-048, data model §3b). The surviving summaries must be recomputed by
collapsing ``interaction_fact_resource`` over the surviving resources.
Selecting rows from ``interaction_fact_combined`` with ``sources &&
ARRAY[...]`` returns the right interactions carrying numbers that describe
resources the license excluded. The last test holds that shortcut to be a
defect by showing the two answers differ.
