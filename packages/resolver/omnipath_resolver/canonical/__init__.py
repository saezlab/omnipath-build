"""Entity canonicalization: reference library + unique-match resolution.

* :mod:`.policy`      – per entity class: which library, which namespaces vote, how to label
* :mod:`.identifiers` – identifier normalization shared by builder and matcher
* :mod:`.library`     – pin an immutable published reference
* :mod:`.match`       – set-based matching of observations against a library
* :mod:`.label`       – label choice for unmatched observations
* :mod:`.stats`       – resolution counters

See ``README.md`` in this directory for the conceptual description.
