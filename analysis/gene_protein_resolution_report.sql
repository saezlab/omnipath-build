-- gene_protein_resolution_report.sql
--
-- Evaluate gene/protein entity resolution in a built OmniPath DB: how many
-- unique genes, how many protein mentions ground to a real gene vs a virtual
-- ("unknown") gene vs stay unresolved, WHY the unresolved ones fail (by the id
-- they carry), and the same by resource + the per-resource source id type /
-- translation path. Read-only; safe to run on a built instance.
--
-- Usage (build PG has 1 GB /dev/shm; a web PG may have less — this script
-- disables parallel gather so it runs anywhere):
--   PGPASSWORD=… psql -h localhost -p <port> -U omnipath -d omnipath \
--     -f analysis/gene_protein_resolution_report.sql
--
-- Key modelling facts (verify against the DB — vocab ids are assigned SERIALLY
-- per build, so NEVER hard-code them; we look them up by name below):
--   * entity_type Gene:MI:0250 / Protein:MI:0326 — the CANONICAL entity type.
--   * entity_evidence keeps the ORIGINAL mention type; the resolved/canonical
--     type is on `entity` (reached via entity_evidence_resolution.entity_id).
--   * molecular_type 'protein' on entity_evidence_resolution = the mention was
--     a protein; its outcome is the type of the entity it resolved to:
--       - a Gene entity, resolution_mechanism resolver|gene_anchor  -> GROUNDED
--       - a Gene entity, resolution_mechanism 'unknown_gene'        -> VIRTUAL gene
--       - still a Protein entity (status unresolved)                -> UNRESOLVED
--   * entity_evidence_resolution.reason_id is NOT populated — we derive the
--     unresolved reason from the identifier types the mention carries.
