"""Fill ``data_source_license`` from pypath's resource metadata.

The build database recorded no license anywhere. `data_source` held
``(source_id, name)`` and nothing more, so "everything usable commercially" was
a question no query could ask. This module answers it by loading the terms
pypath already maintains next to its resource definitions.

**Where the terms come from — two sources, one precedence.**

``pypath/resources/data/resources.json`` names a license per resource — a
*name*, such as ``CC BY 4.0``. It is hand-curated one resource at a time, with
the grounds cited in its commit messages, so it is the original license
curation rather than a derived artifact. It **wins wherever it has an entry**.

It covers pypath's *interaction* resources only, and the build has since loaded
chemistry, ontology and single-cell resources it never described. Those are
reached through the second source: every ``inputs_v2`` resource declares a
:class:`pypath.internals.cv_terms.LicenseCV` term — ``license`` is a required
field on ``ResourceConfig`` — and ``sync_resources_table`` already writes that
term's accession into ``resources.license``. The CV term **fills the gaps** and
never overrides a curated entry, because for a resource ``resources.json`` does
not describe there is no competing curation to lose.

Either way the name is resolved against ``pypath/data/licenses/*.json`` through
:class:`pypath.resources.licenses.Licenses`, which is where the ordinal levels
live: ``purpose``, ``sharing`` and ``attrib``, each a point on a scale from the
smallest to the greatest freedom (``pypath/internals/license.py``). The levels
are read off that model rather than transcribed here, so a license whose terms
are corrected in pypath is corrected in the build at the next load.

**Where the two disagree, the load says so.** Precedence makes the behaviour
defined; it does not make the disagreement resolved. A resource whose curated
entry names one concrete license and whose CV term names another is logged at
WARNING and reported in :class:`LicenseTableStats.conflicts`, because that is a
curation question for a person to settle and not one for this module to decide
quietly.

**The name mapping** is the awkward part on the ``resources.json`` side and is
not invented here. Its keys are display names such as ``CellChatDB``, while
``data_source.name`` holds slugs such as ``cellchat``. The build already
resolves the two through the three-name model
(``pypath.inputs_v2.resource_names``), whose filter index maps every
{slug, slugified short name, slugified synonym} onto one canonical slug, and
whose registry maps that slug back to the ``resources.json`` key. The candidate
names a source offers the index are its own slug and the short/full/synonym
names ``sync_resources_table`` already resolved into the ``resources`` table —
the same mapping, read rather than rebuilt.

**Unknown terms are exclusions, never defaults.** A source the mapping
does not reach gets a row all the same, carrying ``is_known = false`` and no
levels at all. Nothing here invents a level for it: a NULL level is silently
dropped by a range predicate, which is the right answer for the wrong reason,
so the exclusion is carried by ``is_known`` and never by the numbers. A license
that maps but whose level pypath cannot place on its scale is treated the same
way — pypath scores an unplaceable level 99, which every ``>=`` filter admits,
and admitting it is exactly the failure mode this table cannot detect
downstream. ``LicenseCV.UNSPECIFIED`` says the same thing in the vocabulary's
own words and is treated the same: it is the absence of terms, never a
permissive default, and it never turns a resource known.

Call it once per build, and **after** ``sync_resources_table``: it reads both
the resolved resource names and the declared CV term out of the ``resources``
table that step fills. Run before it, and every resource falls back to the
curated entry alone.
