    ``build_id`` is the SHA-256 of the canonical sorted-key JSON of
    ``{package_commits, resources}`` (12 hex chars) — reproducible for identical
    content, independent of ``built_at``. One current row per build (TRUNCATE +
    INSERT). Projects per-resource provenance from the ``resources`` table, so it
    runs in ``derive`` right after ``sync_resources_table``.

    ``derive_cost`` is what the interaction derive steps cost this run — seconds
    and rows per step (record fact, assay, party, reaction projection,
    intercell), either as ``{step: {seconds, rows}}`` or as a sequence of such
    records. The **interaction table is named apart** under
    ``interaction_tables`` as ``record`` (T020b), so the cost FR-036's ceiling is
    argued against is readable without knowing which step wrote the table.

    ``scope_cost`` is what materialising each query scope cost — seconds, rows
    and whether it was materialised at all, per scope — either as
    ``{scope: {...}}`` or as a sequence of ``{scope, ...}`` records. FR-050 wants
    this for **every** scope measured, so that declining to materialise a scope
    stays an available answer to a cost overrun.

    ``deferral_cost`` is what deferring the foreign keys and the secondary
    indexes over the load bought (T013k, R23): the seconds it saved, and the
    seconds the drop, the restore and the revalidation cost — see
    :func:`_interactions_deferral_cost`. All three are optional: a build that
    recorded none of them still emits a manifest.

    The cost is written to ``interactions_derive_cost``, the deferral to
    ``interactions_deferral_cost``, and both, with the ``network_presets``
    inventory read from ``network_registry``, stay **outside** the hashed
    payload: all of it is volatile — timings vary run to run and the preset list
    changes without the built content changing — and none of it may move a
    build's identity (the cycle-007 lesson). The hash covers

    R23 takes the deferral: the load runs with the 13 foreign keys and the 18
    secondary indexes off and puts them back validated, at 709.7 s against
    1,814.7 s, with revalidation set-based at 44.6 s against 726.3 s of per-row
    triggers. Recording it per build is what makes a regression in the deferral
    show up in the manifest rather than in somebody's stopwatch.

    Normalises one record to::

        {deferred, seconds_saved, drop_seconds, restore_seconds,
         revalidate_seconds, constraints_deferred, indexes_deferred,
         catalogue_unchanged}

    ``seconds_saved``
        the load without the deferral less the load with it. The producer
        computes it; the manifest records it, because the baseline is not a
        thing this build ran.
    ``drop_seconds`` / ``restore_seconds`` / ``revalidate_seconds``
        the three halves of the mechanism's own cost, kept apart from the load
        (data-model §10) — the revalidation is the one that could quietly be
        skipped, and a deferral that returns a `NOT VALID` key has saved
        nothing.
    ``catalogue_unchanged``
        whether the catalogue on the far side matched the near side (T013i).

    Every field is ``None`` when the producer did not report it, and the whole
    record is ``None`` when it reported nothing readable — **a build that ran
    without the deferral says nothing rather than claiming zero**. Zero seconds
    saved is a measurement, and it is a regression to chase; no deferral at all
    is not, and the two must not read alike.

    A field that cannot be read as its kind is warned about and dropped, never
    raised: a malformed number from the derive must not cost the build its
    manifest. ``deferred`` is inferred from the presence of a measurement when
    the record does not say, the way ``materialised`` is inferred from
