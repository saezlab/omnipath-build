-- The reaction edges: every (enzyme, reactant) and every (enzyme, product).
--
-- The reaction star is already assembled. The interaction projection wrote one
-- N-ary header per reaction and one `interaction_party` row per participant,
-- each in the role its resources published, so this step reads roles rather
-- than re-deriving them from annotations.
--
-- Only `reactant`, `product` and `enzyme` are projected. `cofactor`,
-- `regulator` and `member` are counted and left out: the binarisation COSMOS
-- was built from has no such roles, every species in it is a reactant or a
-- product by the sign of its coefficient, and projecting a regulator as a
-- substrate would state something no resource said.
--
-- A reaction the resources call reversible is emitted twice: once as written,
-- and once with the arrow turned round, so that the products feed the enzyme
-- and the reactants come out of it. The gene node of the second half carries
-- the `_rev` suffix, which is what makes it a node of its own; the metabolite
-- labels are untouched, because a molecule is the same molecule whichever way
-- the reaction runs. Both halves keep the reaction's index.
--
-- A reaction nobody stated a direction for is emitted forward only, and
-- `direction` stays null rather than being filled in. Rhea publishes no
-- direction on any of its reactions, so the null block is large, and it means
-- "no resource said" — which is not the same claim as "runs one way".
