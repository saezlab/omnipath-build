-- The connectors: one edge per distinct gene node, from the bare identifier to
-- the node that carries it.
--
-- A gene node is an enzyme in one reaction, so its label is unusable as a join
-- key by anything upstream: transcriptomics arrives keyed on a gene, not on a
-- gene-in-a-reaction. The connector is the attachment point, and it is what
-- lets a measurement reach every instance of its enzyme at once.
--
-- The bare side of an orphan node is the reaction's own identifier, not the
-- `orphanReac` spelling of it, because that is the identifier a caller holds.
-- The reverse half of a reversible reaction is a node of its own, so it gets
-- its own connector from the same bare identifier.
--
-- Metabolite nodes get no connector. Their labels are the identifier plus a
-- compartment suffix, which a consumer can strip; a gene label cannot be
-- stripped without knowing the reaction index.
