"""Declarative network-view framework (Milestone G; presets since cycle 008).

A dataset is described by a :class:`NetworkDefinition` and registered as one
``network_registry`` row. Two generations of definition share that table:

* the **preset** (cycle 008) — metadata over the interaction fact table: which
  sources contribute, which interaction classes and evidence it scopes to, which
  attributes it returns, how it is labelled and curated. It materialises nothing;
  registering it is the whole build step.
* the **matview network** (Milestone G) — metadata plus the curated SQL that
  materialises per-source and combined matviews under its own schema.

The framework manages both uniformly — create the schema and apply the SQL where
there is any, refresh the matviews, and upsert the registry row — so a uniform
API discovers and serves either. Adding a dataset is a definition, never bespoke
framework or API code.

**Transitional columns.** ``schema_name`` and ``combined_relation`` describe a
matview and mean nothing for a preset; they stay nullable while both generations
coexist and are dropped when the last bespoke matview retires. They are
recorded here so they are not left behind as silent dead columns.

**Grain amendment (2026-08-20).** A preset also says how it collapses the
per-resource record over its own resource scope (``collapse_mode``) and which
license terms a resource must meet to contribute (``license_scope``). Neither
buys a preset a table of its own: a third column, ``materialize_collapse``, was
proposed and withdrawn the same day, because interaction queries are served from
one precomputed record table rather than from N per-dataset ones, and a derived
table built only when a flag says so is the silently skipped phase constitution
Principle V rules out. There are two interaction tables and both are built
unconditionally — a scoped preset collapses the record at query time.

**Composition amendment (2026-08-21).** A preset is a parameter set or a
composition of them, and never a third thing. A composition names its components
in order and the operation that joins them (``composition``); a component is
either a parameter set or the name of another preset, which is where a
per-component override comes from. Most presets are one parameter set and leave
the column NULL. The algebra runs in the api-service, not here — the
build stores the recipe and nothing executes it.

class NetworkDefinition:
    """A dataset: a preset over the fact table, or a matview-backed network.

    The preset fields (data-model §9) describe *what a query for this dataset
    selects and returns*; they carry no SQL:

    ``interaction_class_scope``
        Interaction-class slugs (data-model §8: ``signaling``, ``tf_target``,
        ``ligand_receptor``, …) the preset restricts to; empty means all classes.
        A class is derived from the resource annotations, never from a legacy
        dataset name — a legacy name is preset identity, not a class.
    ``evidence_scope``
        The evidence-type / predicate / confidence filter separating the
        legacy datasets that share a class.
    ``default_attributes`` / ``mandatory_attributes``
        Returned when the caller asks for nothing, and returned always even
        when unrequested.
    ``labels``
        Display labels for the preset and its columns.
    ``curation``
        Configurable thresholds and flags — MoA-only, affinity cut-off,
        metabolite-class gate — as config, never inline SQL.
    ``attribute_sources``
        Which source supplies each mandatory attribute, carrying the
        interim-vs-Intercell provenance.
    ``collapse_mode``
        How the preset folds the per-resource record over *its own* resource
        scope: ``none`` keeps one row per resource assertion, ``assertion``
        folds the resources that agree on sign and direction, and ``endpoints``
        — the default — folds to the collapsed key, the legacy
        one-row-per-interaction contract. A single-resource preset collapses
        nothing whatever the mode says, because every group holds one row.
    ``license_scope``
        The minimum ``purpose`` / ``sharing`` / ``attrib`` levels a resource
        must meet to contribute. ``None`` is no restriction at all; a scope that
        is set resolves to a resource set before the query runs, and a resource
        whose license is unknown fails it however permissive its recorded
        levels read — never admitted by default.
    ``composition``
        The recipe of a preset that is not one query: the ordered
        ``components`` and the ``operation`` joining them, then the ordered
        ``steps`` that follow. A component is a parameter set or the name of
        another preset — the second form is what lets an override replace one
        component and leave the rest of the recipe alone. ``None`` — the common
        case — means the preset is a single parameter set. The order is part of
        the value: the collapse follows the union and folds over the union's own
        resolved scope, and the exclude precedes the collapse, because a
        resource dropped after the fold still counts towards ``source_count``,
        the references and the sign flags. The api-service executes the algebra;
        the registry only stores it.

    ``schema``, ``combined_relation``, ``matviews`` and ``sql_files`` are the
    matview-era fields: a preset leaves them empty.
