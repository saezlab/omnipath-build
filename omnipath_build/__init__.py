    Resolves the temp base from ``tmpdir`` (e.g. the ``--tmpdir`` CLI flag) or,
    when that is not given, from the ``OMNIPATH_BUILD_TMPDIR`` environment
    variable. When a value is found the directory is created and made the
    process-wide default for both Python's :mod:`tempfile` and child processes
    (via ``TMPDIR``), so every ``tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`` and DuckDB
    file-backed spill lands there instead of the root filesystem's ``/tmp``.

    A full build can spill several hundred GB of DuckDB temp storage; pointing
    this at large scratch storage keeps that off ``/`` (which otherwise fills
    and can take down co-located services). Returns the resolved absolute path,
    or ``None`` when neither source is set (callers keep the system default).
