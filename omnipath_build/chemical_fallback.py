"""Non-lipid chemical fallback resolution (US1 T020, research R22).

When a chemical mention has no usable **structure** (InChIKey), the legacy
resolver dropped it to the opaque ``unresolved_entity_key`` md5 hash — ~44% of
chemicals. R22 replaces the distrusted transitive co-occurrence clustering with
a **per-record, priority-ordered pick** (no transitivity, no false chain-merges):
each structure-less chemical canonicalises to its single best identifier by a
fixed priority, recording the producing ``resolution_mechanism``.

Priority (this module — STAGE 1):

  ChEBI → ChEMBL → PubChem → SwissLipids → HMDB → LIPID MAPS
  → keep-original (any other real external id, e.g. KEGG/FooDB/MetaNetX/CAS…)
  → name (exact, basic collision handling)

A mention's primary id is therefore never a lower-priority id when a higher one
is present (a ChEBI+PubChem record anchors on ChEBI). Same id across resources
merges; different ids stay distinct. **InChIKey** is intentionally absent —
those mentions resolve through the existing direct InChIKey path and never reach
here. **SMILES** is also intentionally absent (R9/T046): a structure-less lipid
like ``PC(18:1_16:0)`` yields a placeholder SMILES that would collapse distinct
species, so SMILES is never a canonical merge key — it stays an attached
identifier only.

Deferred to a follow-up (R22 steps 4–5, the ~3.4% non-priority bulk): the
**within-resource id merge** (FooDB membership→compound, lifting structure-less
membership rows onto the structured compound that shares their FooDB id) and the
**ChEBI-xref 1:1 translation** (CAS/KEGG→ChEBI, abort on 1→many). UniChem is not
ingested. Until then those ids resolve via *keep-original* (a stable id, the
``original_id`` mechanism — still far better than the md5 hash).

The result table ``chemical_fallback_resolution`` is consumed by
``entity_resolution_base``'s unresolved branch: it is applied only to chemical
mentions the structure + resolver-candidate paths left unresolved.
