"""Session and logging setup via ``pkg_infra`` (research R17).

Importing this module configures the whole logging tree once, so every other
module in the package takes a plain ``logging.getLogger(__name__)`` and
inherits the ``pkg_infra`` handlers and format. The package ``__init__``
imports it — without that import the configuration never runs, which is
exactly the bug the omnipath-utils reference implementation carries.

# `pkg_infra` installs the root handlers but leaves the root logger at WARNING,

# steps' structured `step=… event=…` progress output that T013c and T020 read
# their figures from. Set the level the package already expected on the package
# logger, where it is not at the mercy of a host that never called
# `basicConfig` (and where a `basicConfig` call would be a no-op anyway, root
# now carrying handlers).
