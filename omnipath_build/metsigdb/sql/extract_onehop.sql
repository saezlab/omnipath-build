-- One-hop membership extraction: a set entity is `associated_with` a chemical.
--
-- Reactome, WikiPathways and ClassyFire's direct assignments all have this
-- shape. The set sits on the entity side of the relation, the metabolite on the
-- evidence side, and one join through `entity_evidence_resolution` turns the
-- evidence into a canonical entity.
--
-- Only `status_id = 1` publishes. Status 2 carries a placeholder entity minted
-- for an unresolved key, not a canonical one, and the row contract excludes it.
--
-- The source names the same metabolite in a set several times, so DISTINCT ON
-- folds the evidence rows to one row per pair and keeps the lowest-numbered
-- evidence as the provenance record.
