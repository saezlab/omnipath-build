-- KEGG membership extraction: two hops, through the reaction.
--
-- KEGG publishes no compound-to-pathway edge. A pathway is `associated_with` a
-- reaction, and the reaction `has_participant` a compound, so a compound
-- reaches a pathway only through a reaction assigned to it.
--
-- The reaction is an internal join key and is never published, so this
-- extraction does not require it to resolve canonically. It requires the
-- compound end to resolve, because that is the end the substrate publishes.
-- The difference is large: requiring both ends gives 1,272 memberships, and
-- requiring the compound alone gives 4,969.
--
-- Seven in ten KEGG compound participations stay unresolved in the core build,
-- so KEGG publishes far fewer memberships than its raw edge count suggests.
-- That is an upstream gap, recorded in contracts/mapping-rules.md.
--
-- This file is interpolated with bind parameters, so it carries no bare percent
-- sign, not even inside a comment.
