"""Build the MetSigDB membership substrate from the build database.

The step reads what the core build already wrote. It parses no upstream
resource and downloads nothing: `relation_evidence`,
`entity_evidence_resolution` and `entity_ontology_relation` already hold every
membership, resolved against the canonical entity layer.

Each resource runs the same three phases. An extraction query stages one row
per published pair, a shared projection reads the metabolite side off the
canonical layer, and a shared upsert writes the rows under their deterministic
identity. Only the extraction differs per resource.
